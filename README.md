The full criteria for evaluating the coding challenge can be found [here](./Criteria.md).

# How to submit

- Clone this repository.
- A RESTful API for `todos` is provided with the challenge. See: [API server](#api-server)
- Complete your project as described above within your local repository.
- Ensure everything you want to commit is committed before you bundle.
- Create a git bundle: `git bundle create your_name.bundle --all`

# API server

The service [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) includes all the necessary methods required to achieve the goal (`POST`, `GET`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE`).

Check [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) for more information.

# Time limit

There is no hard time limit for this coding challenge. However, we believe that 6-8 hours is sufficient for the [must-have parts of the application](Criteria.md#must-have). Happy coding!

Good luck,
